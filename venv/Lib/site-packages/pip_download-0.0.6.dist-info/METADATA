pip-download
============

pip-download is a tool which can be used to download python projects and their dependencies listed on
pypi's `download files` page. If you run the `pip-download` command to download one project on a Linux platform,
packages end with `.whl` and can be directly installed on a Windows and a macOS platform will also be downloaded.
In that way, you can use these downloaded packages to serve for a minimal
pypi sever(like `pypiserver <https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/>`_ on your company internal network.

At first, it uses `pip download xxx` command to download packages of the project `xxx` to a temp dir. Then it unpacks
these downloaded packages' name and version to download all packages of the project `xxx`. These downloaded
packages include packages end with `.whl` built on the Linux, Windows, macOS platform and the source packages end with
`.tar.gz` or `.zip` .
